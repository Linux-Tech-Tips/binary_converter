# Binary Converter

This project will be a simple command line tool to convert binary numbers read from the user into other numeric systems.
Written entirely, directly in binary.

Manually, byte by byte, in a hex editor, because I am certainly a person of all time, with a set of hobbies of all time, apparently.

Written for Linux, because I like ELF <3 and for AArch64 because it's simply a better architecture, with no bias whatsoever from my side.

Currently Work In Progress, will be finished hopefully at some point in the future.
